# SFND 2D Feature Tracking

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

This project builds the feature tracking on camera images and tests various detector / descriptor combinations to see which ones perform best. In evaluating the combinations speed of feature tracking and percentage of match on the tracked features are considered. The project consists of four parts:

* First, we will focus on loading images, setting up data structures and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize memory load. 
* Then, integrate several keypoint detectors such as HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed. 
* In the next part, we focus on descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN approach. 
* In the last part, we will test various algorithms in different combinations and compare them with regard to some performance measures. 

## Note:
A detailed report on the project is given in the pdf "Camera_2D_Feature_Tracking_Writeup.pdf" (on this repo).

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * This must be compiled from source using the `-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` cmake flag for testing the SIFT and SURF detectors.
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
